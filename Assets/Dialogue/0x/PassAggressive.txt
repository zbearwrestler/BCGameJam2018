Games are literature!
Games send messages like psychic mediums.
Video Games don't explore the meaning of being human.
The Smithsonian American Art Museum held an exhibit entitled __[INSERT WHITE CARD]__.
Games are a form of espresso
To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand what I'm saying.
Do you even lift?
Row Row Fight the Power!
Museums have art in them.
=======
Games ARE better than literature!
You don't seem able to decree art.
Have you played a game?
I bet you loved Farmville
Have you done any research?
What Vlogger told you this?
Can you not change?
Do you hate games cause you suck?
Are you always so negative?
What game did you fail at?
Where did the controller touch you?
Face me online... if you can.
You bad at all games or just video?
Go play football
You are living in the past
Yeah, poetry is always art
A big black square...True Art
Blank Canvas, Truly emotional
The whole art crowd is arrogant as you
I know a great poem from Nantucket
Is wrestling a play for you?
Troll 2 was just so moving
Go ahead cling to the past
Conservative nut-job
Vincent Van Goh was a hack
