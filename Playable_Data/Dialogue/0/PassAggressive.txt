Games ARE better than literature!
You don't seem able to decree art.
Have you played a game?
I bet you loved Farmville
Have you done any research?
What Vlogger told you this?
Can you not change?
Do you hate games cause you suck?
Are you always so negative?
What game did you fail at?
Where did the controller touch you?
Face me online... if you can.
You bad at all games or just video?
Go play football
You are living in the past
Yeah, poetry is always art
A big black square...True Art
Blank Canvas, Truly emotional
The whole art crowd is arrogant as you
I know a great poem from Nantucket
Is wrestling a play for you?
Troll 2 was just so moving
Go ahead cling to the past
Conservative nut-job
Vincent Van Goh was a hack
