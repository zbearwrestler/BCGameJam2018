Games can be childish.
You shouldn't be able to win art
Kojima argued against you
The act of play ruins intent
Where do we draw the line now?
Video games are only for kids
Mr Ebert said games will never be art
Video games can be fun.
Art should be about intent not content
Video games differ from classic art
They are just a games
Art should be experienced not interacted
If video games are art what of board games?
There is no elegant context
Challenges can detract from the message
Can you enjoy the arrangement of a game
Are games good at invoking emotion?
Can you step back and enjoy a game
Interaction changes perception
Can you appreciate the Circumstance if you are involved
How do you compare games and poetry
How do you compare games and film
How do you compare games and painting
How do you compare games and music
Goals can ruin experiences
